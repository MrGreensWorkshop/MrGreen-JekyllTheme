### About Node JS

{:data-align="center"}

<!-- outline-end -->

Today we're going to learn about Node.js, a language that developers use a lot but don't know **Why**.

#### Concept

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment, one of the tools used to develop web servers.

#### Advantages

It has an asynchronous, event-driven architecture, providing high throughput and scalability, and is ideal for building real-time web applications.

#### Utilization

Node.js can create web servers through its built-in HTTP module. Developers can use the HTTP module to receive HTTP requests, generate responses, and send them to clients. This allows Node.js to act as a web server, and you can develop server applications that handle responses to client requests.

#### Ecosystem

Node.js includes web frameworks such as Express, Koa, Hapi, and others. These frameworks make web server development easier and more efficient. In addition to web servers, you can also use Node.js to develop other parts of web applications: API servers, real-time communication, microservices, etc.

#### Summary

Node.js is a popular tool for building web servers using JavaScript.
