### About Swift

{:data-align="center"}

<!-- outline-end -->

I'm in a situation where I need to learn about iOS, so I'm doing some research.
While researching courses, I became curious about a language called swift, which is aimed at developing iOS native apps.

#### What is Swift?

Swift is a programming language developed by Apple for products like iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. It was first released in 2014 and is designed to be compatible with Objective-C. It is characterized by being relatively easy to write, secure, and fast compared to other C languages.

Swift is available for Apple's devices as well as other platforms such as Linux, and is also used for server-side development through the community-driven project Swift on Server. The latest version of Swift offers modern programming features such as option handling, pattern matching, and functional programming paradigms.

##### Features

Swift emphasizes type safety to reduce runtime errors, and provides a number of features to increase the clarity and efficiency of code. These characteristics help programmers write more efficient and reliable code.

It's also compatible with Objective-C, so we thought we'd check it out.

But what is Objective-C?

#### What is Objective-C?

Objective-C is an object-oriented programming language. It's based on the C language and is designed with the object-oriented features of Smalltalk.
It was adopted by Apple as the primary programming language for macOS and iOS, and in the years since, many Apple applications and frameworks have been written in Objective-C.
The language is fully compatible, meaning you can use C code directly or call C libraries. However, the syntax can be complex, and some parts, such as memory management, can be difficult to handle.
Apple introduced Swift as a successor to Objective-C, which has made it less and less important, but it is still used in many existing projects and systems.
