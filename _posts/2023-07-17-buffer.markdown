### About buffers

{:data-align="center"}

<!-- outline-end -->

One day, I was asked by a development colleague what a buffer was.
Realizing that I had heard the word a lot, but didn't really know what it was, I did some research and wrote about it.

First of all, what is a buffer?

#### What is a buffer?

A term used in computer science that refers to an area of memory that temporarily stores data. A buffer serves to temporarily store data while it is being transferred from one place to another.

So here's the question. What does buffering, which we often use in our daily lives when we're waiting to watch a video, mean?

#### What is buffering?

It refers to the process or technique of using buffers to temporarily store data.
Buffering utilizes buffers to regulate the flow of data and mitigate speed differences or delays between sending and receiving data.

So let's come back and see how buffers are used.

#### How buffers are used

When reading a file, the operating system reads a certain amount of data at a time and stores it in a buffer. Later, programs read data from the buffer.

#### Benefits of using buffers

It's more efficient and faster than reading a file several times in small chunks. This is because data can be stored or transferred all at once.

#### Conclusion

A buffer is a conceptual term used to describe the temporary storage of data and the throttling of processing speed to improve system performance.
