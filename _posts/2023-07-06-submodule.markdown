Some of you have developed and applied submodules in your projects, and I wanted to make sure you know exactly what submodules are.

#### What is a submodule?

In software development, it refers to a sub-concept of Module. A module is a functional part that can be organized and managed independently, and is typically used as part of a larger system.

So what is a module?

#### What is a module?

A module is a functional part of software development that can be configured and managed independently. Modules are used to organize software systems and facilitate development.

A module is typically a set of code that performs a specific function or task. By breaking a large program or system into smaller units and organizing them into modules, you can improve the structure and maintainability of your code.

#### Purpose of using submodules

Submodules generally help to distribute tasks within a module and improve the maintainability of the code. They can also simplify the development process and increase the reusability of code by minimizing dependencies between modules.
Submodules can be used in other fields as well as software development, and they help manage complexity by forming a hierarchical structure.
