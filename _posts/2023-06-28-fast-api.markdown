### What is the Fast API

{:data-align="center"}

<!-- outline-end -->

Today we're going to learn about Fast API, a framework used to develop Python-based web APIs.

Before we dive in, I wanted to find out if it's common to develop servers in Python, because the server developers I know have mostly used Spring, which is based on Java.

#### Top 5 most popular languages for web development

Based on the results of Stack Overflow's developer survey in 2021, with their respective shares

1. JavaScript: 67.8
2. HTML/CSS: 63.1
3. SQL: 56.5
4. Python: 50.7
5. Java: 39.7

The above rankings and shares are based on the most popular languages used by developers for web development. It's important to note that the shares for each language do not add up to 100%, and there may be some overlap as developers often use a mix of languages.

As you can see, there are more people doing web development in Python than there are Java users!

Now that we know that a lot of people use Python, let's talk about the web framework Fast API, which is based on it.

#### Fast API Concept

FastAPI is designed for modern Python web development and utilizes Python 3.6 and later features like Type Hints for efficient development.
Type hints allow developers to write code more clearly and utilize the IDE's autocomplete features to develop faster.

#### Features

FastAPI is a Python-based web framework that is characterized by its fast speed and easy development experience.
FastAPI also provides API documentation auto-generation features such as Swagger, which makes it easy to see how an API is used and its data model, and the Pydantic library makes it convenient to handle tasks such as data validation and serialization.
