### Implementing hashtag functionality

{:data-align="center"}

<!-- outline-end -->

On social media, hashtags are often considered a must-have feature.
They can trigger interactions between users, and they can also be used as a trending and marketing element.

I had the opportunity to implement hashtags at my current company, so I thought I'd walk through a simple example to show you how to do it.

#### Hashtag implementation example

1. Create a hashtag component: Create a React component to display the hashtag.

```javascript
# hashtag.js

import React from 'react';

const Hashtag = ({ tag }) => {
  return <span>#{tag}</span>;
};
```

2. Use hashtags: Use the component to display hashtags.

```javascript
# App.js
import React from 'react';
import Hashtag from './Hashtag';

const App = () => {
  const hashtags = ['react', 'javascript', 'webdevelopment'];

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>해시태그</h1>
      {hashtags.map((tag, index) => (
        <Hashtag key={index} tag={tag} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

The above example creates a Hashtag component to display hashtags, and maps the hashtags stored in the 'hashtags' array in the 'App' component to display them on the screen.
We used the 'key' prop as a unique identifier that React needs when rendering the component list.

Next, we'll talk about how hashtags should be designed to be implemented on the server.
