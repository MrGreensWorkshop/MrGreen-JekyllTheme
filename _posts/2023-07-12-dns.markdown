### About DNS

{:data-align="center"}

<!-- outline-end -->

The concept of DNS comes up a lot in development.
You may have an idea of what it means, but let's find out exactly what the acronym stands for and what it means!

#### Concept

DNS stands for Domain Name System, a system that translates domain names used on the internet into IP addresses.
Devices connected to the internet use IP addresses to communicate with each other. However, it's hard for people to remember an IP address as a series of numbers, so they identify a website or network service with a meaningful string of characters called a domain name.

Example: ####

When a user enters a domain name, the domain name is translated into a corresponding IP address, which enables communication between the computer and the network.
For example, when a user types "www.example.com" into a web browser, DNS translates that domain name into an IP address and sends a request.
The server then accepts the request from that IP address, sends the web page to the user's browser, and displays it.

The #### role

DNS also determines the location of various network services associated with a domain name, such as email servers, FTP servers, VoIP servers, and more.
DNS consists of a globally distributed network of DNS servers that are responsible for managing and communicating the mapping information of domain names to IP addresses.

There are also some concepts that you may not be familiar with, such as FTP and VoIP.

#### What is FTP?

FTP stands for "File Transfer Protocol," a protocol used to transfer files over a computer network.
FTP supports file transfers between clients and servers, and is commonly used by web developers, system administrators, and others to upload, download, delete, and move files.

#### What is VoIP?

VoIP is an acronym for "Voice over Internet Protocol" and refers to a technology that transmits voice calls over the Internet Protocol.
Unlike traditional telephony, phone calls are not carried as analog signals, but instead are converted into digital data packets and transmitted over the internet.
