        ## Business Plan

        ### 1. Problem & Solution

        It has been about 4 years since the technology called 'blockchain' has emerged as an issue, but the public still only knows the concept of blockchain, not what it is, where it is used, or what can be done with it. Blockchain-related startups as well as large enterprises are actively entering the industry. Despite this multifaceted effort, blockchain is still unfamiliar. 
        The team focused on this phenomenon and attributed it to the lack of user-friendly channels and lightweight content. Games were deemed to be the best content to promote accessibility. Blockchain technology is expected to increase the transparency of the reward system and shorten the initial trust-building period. The utilization of SDKs is expected to resolve user usage constraints such as wallet and key management.
        Looking at the current situation, Samsung has created 'Samsung Blockchain Wallet' to foster the blockchain industry and has released various DApps on it. We found that many game DApps are in service to commercialize blockchain technology, but most of them are not performing well. In particular, none of them have been passed by the Game Content Management Committee, and the relevant laws and regulations are vague. In addition to external factors, the content itself is not appealing to users. The team analyzed these reasons and designed this service with various improvements.

        ### 2. Introduction of Idea
        1) How to play
        Getcha Crayon is inspired by the 'treasure hunting' game that we used to play during childhood picnics. However, we want to utilize virtual space instead of physical space and provide treasures in the form of gift icons. After accessing the service, users can create a room of their choice (chicken room, coffee room, etc.) or enter an already created room. Before the game starts, users pay the same amount of coins as a participation fee and proceed with the game. The location of the treasure is randomized on the map, and the first user to find it will receive all the coins deposited in the room before the game starts in the form of a gift icon.
        2) Strengths and Differentiation
        Existing blockchain games have the problem of having to go through various processes to deposit and distribute coins. However, this game compresses these complex processes into a single process by utilizing the SDK, so there is no need to create a separate platform for this. In other words, it can be said that the user-friendly process simplification is an advantage. Furthermore, the service is easily accessible to anyone with a Samsung smartphone released after the Galaxy S10, so all you need is to have the device in your possession. Currently, most blockchain games do not have high graphics, but Getcha Crayon is 3D, which makes the game more lively. At the same time, the reward system is transparent due to the use of blockchain technology, which builds trust among users and reduces additional marketing costs. 

        ### 3. Customer and Market Analysis
        1) Target Market: (Initial: 8,000 users / Mid-term (3 years): 18,500)
        TAM - Gifticon users (about 17 million people)_Source platum
        SAM - DApp users: about 1.5 million (worldwide)_Source: KOTRA,
        Domestic users are estimated to be about 10% of these_Source: Ministry of Science and ICT. (2018). Guide to National R&D Project Information
        SOM - Game DApp users: About 750,000 (worldwide), domestic users are estimated to be about 10% of them.
        2) Blockchain game DAPP market attractiveness: 2.5 stars
        a) Barriers to entry: High in terms of utilizing blockchain technology, but online game companies will have their own advantages when entering the market (Threat: Middle / Importance: 25%)
        b) Competition: Most of the top-ranked games in the DAPP market are games, but there are differences in the form of rewards (gift icons) and game quality (3D). (Threat: Middle / Importance: 25%)
        c) Buyer bargaining power: Users of the game play according to the smart contract set on the blockchain program, so bargaining power is weak (Threat: Low / Importance: 10%)
        d) Threat of substitutes: All time-killing media and SNS such as existing mobile and online games, YouTube, and real-time TV apps are applicable (Threat: Middle / Importance: 25%)
        e) Bargaining power of suppliers: Game creators cannot be manipulated on the blockchain, but they should consider using a DB that provides and processes high-end games. (Threat: Low / Importance: 15%)

        ### 4. Business Model - (The team aims for a B2C business model, and the following are listed in order of priority.)
        1) If we can secure a partnership with a gifting company and get a discounted price from the regular price, we will utilize this part as operating funds.
        2) Selling in-game character items: skins, accessories, characters, etc. without affecting the game itself (we expect that users will want to differentiate their characters as the number of users grows).
        3) Advertising income through reward product headquarters or banner operations
        4) Receiving a certain % fee when entering the game → preferably in the form of interest pile distribution utilizing deposits such as pooled funds

        ### 5. Financial Plan
        1) Revenue structure 
        * Number of DApp users: 13,500 users (using the median of 8,500 users in the initial period / 18,500 users in the mid-term)
        S10 users: 1,700,000 / Estimated post-S20 users (within 3 years): 2,000,000
        Probability of using KEYSTORE: 5% / Probability of using Getcha Crayon: 10
        * Average daily transaction amount: 27 million won - 2 (average number of plays by users per day) * 2,000 (average payment per play) * 13,500 (estimated DAPP users) * 0.5 (actual play rate among users)
        * BEP: 15,000 users (estimated 2.5 years after service start) - Revenue function: y = 2347.5x / Cost function: y = 27000 + 468x [y: amount of money (million won) / x: number of users (1,000)]
        * Estimated annual revenue: 23,475 million won
        a) IP business (in-game character items & goods sales): KRW 3,645 million
        - 270,000 (IP revenue per user per year) * 0.01 (market share estimate compared to industry leader) * 13,500 (DAPP user estimate)
        b) Discount for corporate gifting: KRW 19,440,000
        0.03 (SENDBEE - discount up to 15%) * 27,000,000 (average daily transaction amount) * 20 (monthly conversion) * 12 (annual conversion)
        c) Advertising income through reward product headquarters or banner operation: 3.9 million won
        400(Banner impression unit price - CPM) * 0.001(CPM converted to 1 unit) * 3(Number of operating banners) * 2(Number of impressions per user) * 6,750(Average daily users) * 20(Monthly conversion) * 12(Annual conversion)
        2) Funding plan
        Development cost: Short-term (1~3 months) game developer, UI&UX designer consulting cost
        ✔ Equipment: 1 IMAC (2,500,000)*5, desk and picks (7,500,000)
        Labor: 3,000,000 (average annual salary for a venture) * 5 (number of employees)
        Server operating costs: 13,500 (expected dapp users)*20 (monthly server operating costs per person)*12 (converted to a yearly basis)
        Advertising cost: For initial promotion, target online channels expected to be utilized by the target audience (webtoon, SNS, YouTube, etc.)
        3) Initial Funding Plan
        Startup Zone: 2 years of basic tenancy + up to 1 year extension upon passing the extension review
        Youth Employment Incentive: A program that supports labor costs for promising growth industries, venture companies, etc. without limiting the number of employees.

        ### 6. Future plans
        Currently, the service only has one game. However, we plan to develop the service as the number of users increases and usage increases. First of all, we will activate the IP Business to earn revenue by expanding in-game commerce and selling merchandise. In addition, we will add various games, not just treasure hunting games, to increase user choice. This will allow the service to scale, generating additional revenue and increasing user satisfaction.
